# elPolloLoco

El Pollo Loco is a small browser game which was part of my education at Developer Akadamie in Munich.
It includes and demonstrates object orientated programming in javascript.

Help Pepe, a simple farmer, to prevent his village being overrun by a tall monster chicken.

El Pollo Loco has keyboard controls for PC and laptops as well as ontouch-controls for mobile devices.
